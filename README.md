## About

This project was a mock online marketplace for buying and selling cattle. Users can login, check listings, and upload their own listings to the marketplace.

This web app uses React on the front-end and Firebase for user authentication and image storage and retrieval. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and deployed at https://frontiers-market-anderswallace.vercel.app.
